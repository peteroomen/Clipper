# Clipper — Development

Milestone 0 (walking skeleton). This document lists the exact, tested commands
to set up the toolchain, build the portable core, compile it to WASM, and run
the web app plus its automated audio verification.

All commands assume the repository root unless noted. On this machine the repo
lives at `/home/user/Clipper`.

```

## Prerequisites

- CMake >= 3.16 and a C++17 compiler (clang++ or g++) for the native core.
- Node 18+ and npm for the web app.
- Emscripten SDK for the WASM build (installed by `scripts/setup-emsdk.sh`).

## 1. Native core: build and test

The core has no external dependencies.

```bash
cd core
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/clipper_tests
```

Expected: `All tests passed.` The tests cover gain applied after smoothing
settles, absence of NaNs/infinities, and that the one-pole gain smoothing ramps
gradually across a block (no zipper noise on parameter jumps).

## 2. Install Emscripten (once)

```bash
bash scripts/setup-emsdk.sh
```

Idempotent: it is a no-op if `emcc` is already on `PATH`, and skips the download
if `/home/user/emsdk` already contains an activated SDK. Override the location
with `EMSDK_DIR=/some/path bash scripts/setup-emsdk.sh`.

Installed version on this machine: **emsdk 6.0.3** (emcc 6.0.3).

## 3. Build the WASM artifact

```bash
bash scripts/build-wasm.sh
```

This compiles the core with `-O3 -msimd128` (SIMD enabled, as required for later
oversampled nonlinear stages) and emits a single self-contained ES module to
`web/public/generated/clipper.js`, then copies the worklet
(`web/worklet/clipper-processor.js`) alongside it.

The script sources emsdk automatically if `emcc` is not already on `PATH`.

### WASM loading approach (and why)

Built with **`MODULARIZE=1 EXPORT_ES6=1 SINGLE_FILE=1`**:

- **`SINGLE_FILE`** embeds the `.wasm` as a base64 data URI inside the emitted
  `.js`. AudioWorkletGlobalScope has no `fetch`/`XHR`, so embedding the binary is
  the robust way to get it into the worklet — no network fetch at all.
- **`EXPORT_ES6` + `MODULARIZE`** produce an ES module whose default export is a
  factory. The worklet statically `import`s it (Chromium supports static ES
  imports in AudioWorklet module scripts).
- This avoids `SharedArrayBuffer` / COOP-COEP headers entirely.

Both the WASM module and the worklet are placed under `web/public/`, so they are
served verbatim by Vite in **dev, preview, and production** and are never run
through the bundler. The worklet's `import './clipper.js'` therefore resolves
identically everywhere as a sibling file — sidestepping the known fragility of
bundling AudioWorklet modules. The four exported C functions
(`clipper_create/destroy/set_param/process`) plus `_malloc`/`_free` and
`HEAPF32` are used by the worklet to run each 128-frame render quantum through
the C++ core.

The web build/test will fail with a clear message
(`web/scripts/check-artifact.mjs`) if this artifact is missing.

## 4. Web app: install, build, run

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build      # type-checks (tsc --noEmit) then vite build; checks artifact first
npm run dev        # dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Click **Start audio** (an AudioContext needs a user
gesture to start), then move the **Gain** slider (0..2). Status text shows the
AudioContext state and sample rate. The graph is:
`OscillatorNode (220 Hz sine) -> AudioWorkletNode (WASM gain) -> destination`.
You cannot hear it inside the container; the audio proof is the Playwright test
below.

## 5. Automated browser verification

```bash
cd web
npm test
```

This builds the app, serves it with `vite preview` on port 4173, and runs the
Playwright suite headless in Chromium:

- **Audio test:** renders the 220 Hz sine through the WASM worklet in an
  `OfflineAudioContext` at gain 1.0 and 0.5, asserting the output is non-silent
  and that the steady-state RMS ratio is ~2x (tolerance 1.8–2.2 for the smoothing
  ramp). This proves audio actually flows through the WASM worklet without
  speakers or a microphone.
- **UI test:** asserts the Start audio button and the 0..2 gain slider render.

### Browser note

The container ships a preinstalled Chromium under `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`
(`/opt/pw-browsers`). Do **not** run `playwright install`. `playwright.config.ts`
auto-discovers the `chromium-<build>/chrome-linux/chrome` binary and launches it
with `--no-sandbox` (required when running as root).

## Notes / conventions

- `core/` must never include platform/OS/browser/Emscripten headers. The only
  Emscripten touch point is `EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE` in `src/clipper_c_api.cpp`,
  guarded by `#if defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)` so the file still builds natively.
- Gain smoothing (one-pole, ~5 ms) lives in the core, not in JS, so parameter
  changes are click-free regardless of the host.
- Parameter ids are mirrored in three places and must stay in sync:
  `core/include/clipper/Processor.h` (`clipper::ParamId`),
  `web/src/params.ts` (`PARAM_GAIN`), and
  `web/worklet/clipper-processor.js` (`PARAM_GAIN`).
```
